This contract creates a token called SolarUtilityToken with a total supply of 1,000,000 tokens, each with 18 decimal places. The revenuePerToken variable is set to 12, which means that investors holding 1 token will receive 12% revenue share for every 1200 kWH generated in a month. The maxKWHPerMonth variable is set to 1500, which is the maximum amount of kWH generated in a month that can be used to calculate revenue.

The generateKWH function allows solar panel owners to generate kWH and store it on the blockchain. The claimRevenue function allows token holders to claim their share of revenue based on the kWH generated by their solar panels. The calculateRevenue function calculates the amount of revenue that can be claimed by a token holder based on the kWH generated and the time elapsed since the last claim. The transfer function allows token holders to transfer their tokens to other addresses.

This contract can be deployed on the Binance
